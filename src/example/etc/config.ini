; pidfile               name of the PID file
; connection_threads    number of threads for incoming connections
; data_dir              directory where the data is stored
; storage_engine        storage engine that should be used (only one can be used)
;                       [hashtable, btree, filesystem, memory]
; size_limit			size limit for storage engine (should to be adequat for
